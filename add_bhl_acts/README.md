Allows archivists to add BHL-specific acts to Archivematica PREMIS Rights Statements. That way we don't get anybody misspelling "disseminate"...

Processors will need to install Greasemonkey for Firefox and/or Tampermonkey for Chrome as well as the Add BHL Acts script:
  1. For Firefox users, download latest Greasemonkey addon from: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/ and restart Firefox.
  2. For Chrome users, download latest Tampermonkey addon from: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en
  3. Navigate to: https://github.com/bentley-historical-library/bhl-archivematica-scripts/blob/master/add_bhl_acts/add_bhl_acts.user.js
  4. Click the "Raw" button.
  5. Click the "Install" button.
  6. To update scripts, repeat steps 3-5.
